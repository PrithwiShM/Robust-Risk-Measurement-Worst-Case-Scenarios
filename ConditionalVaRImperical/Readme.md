### Methods
Here we compare 3 methods for commputing CVaR which have either parametric or a distribution form. We compare them to 2 methods that follow a Robust CVaR formulation with certain divergence measures.  
1. Historical CVaR (cvar_hist)  
Computes CVaR directly from the empirical loss distribution in each rolling window.  

**Pros:** Nonparametric, model-free.  
**Cons:** Underestimates tail risk when sample size is small or extreme events are scarce.  

2. Filtered Historical Simulation (cvar_fhs)  
Applies a GARCH filter to de-volatilize returns before computing CVaR, then re-scales back.  

**Pros:** Captures time-varying volatility.  
**Cons:** Relies on correct GARCH specification; can still miss unprecedented shocks.  

3. Parametric GPD CVaR (cvar_gpd_n)  
Fits a Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD) above a high threshold and uses its closed-form tail formulas.  

**Pros:** Smooth tail extrapolation beyond sample data.  
**Cons:** Sensitive to threshold choice; may understate risk if shape is misspecified.  

4. Distributionally Robust CVaR, KL‐Divergence (cvar_dro_kl)  
Solves a worst-case CVaR under an α-divergence ball around the nominal model. This yields a “heavier‐tailed” effective shape parameter but still respects a finite divergence budget.  

**Pros:** Automatically adapts to emerging tail behavior, guarding against small model misspecifications.  
**Cons:** Requires calibrating the divergence radius; involves a Lagrange multiplier 𝜃.  

5. Distributionally Robust CVaR, Wasserstein‐1 (cvar_dro_w1)  
Similar worst-case CVaR but with a Wasserstein‐1 constraint instead of KL. Produces an even more conservative (heavier) tail.  

**Pros:** Strong guarantees under metric perturbations.  
**Cons:** Often overly conservative—large capital reserves.  

-- Results & Discussion
![ CVaR Time Series](CVaR_Time_Series_Plot.png)
- Historical CVaR (orange) remains quite low and only slowly increases toward the crisis period. It fails to bound large losses in late 2008: realized spikes in losses exceed it, risking uncovered exposure.  
- FHS CVaR (green) reacts to volatility clustering and spikes sharply in Q4 2008, but its magnitude often overshoots the realized loss—tying up capital that may never be needed.  
- Parametric GPD CVaR (red) is smooth and monotonic. It underestimates the deepest drawdowns around the Lehman failure, because the fitted tail shape cannot anticipate the unprecedented jump.  
- DRO–KL CVaR (purple) “hugs” the loss series most closely. It rises just enough to cover each new loss spike without overreacting, keeping capital reserves efficient.  
- DRO–W1 CVaR (brown) is the most conservative across the board. Even in calm periods it stays high (∼15%)—protecting against extreme transport-type model shifts but at the cost of large opportunity cost.  

3. Key Takeaways
* Coverage vs. Efficiency Trade-off  
 - Under-coverage (Hist., GPD) can leave the portfolio exposed to ruinous losses.
 - Over-coverage (FHS, Wasserstein-DRO) ties up too much capital in buffers.

* Best Balance  
 - The KL‐Divergence DRO approach delivers a middle ground: it adaptively inflates the tail just enough to cover observed losses (“hugs” the series) while avoiding the overly pessimistic levels of the Wasserstein DRO.
