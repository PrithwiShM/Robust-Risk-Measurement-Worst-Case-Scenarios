# Introduction

This project contains the code implementation of the paper published by PAUL GLASSERMAN and XINGBO XU.

Risk measurement relies on modelling assumptions. Errors in these assumptions introduce errors in risk measurement. This makes risk measurement vulnerable to model risk.
This paper develops tools for quantifying model risk and making risk measurement robust to modeling errors.

This project contains the Robust risk measurement over permisable relative Entropy in different risk measurement scenarios.

Note :- Structurization of this project is still incomplete and will be published in the future.
